# Prefer Libraries Over Custom Code

Use established libraries instead of writing custom implementations when reasonable.

## Guidelines

- **Search first**: Before implementing functionality, check if a well-maintained library exists
- **Don't reinvent**: HTTP clients, parsing, validation, date handling — these are solved problems
- **Custom code**: Only write custom code when there's a genuine gap or the library overhead isn't justified

## Examples

| Task | Use Library | Don't Write Custom |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| HTTP with limits | `got`, `axios` | manual fetch with timeout/redirect handling |
| HTML parsing | `cheerio`, `linkedom` | regex or manual DOM traversal |
| Content extraction | `@mozilla/readability` | custom article extraction |
| Schema validation | `zod`, `yup` | manual validation logic |
| AI APIs | official SDKs (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) | raw HTTP calls |
