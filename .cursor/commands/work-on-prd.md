1. Find the highest priority feature to work on and work only on that feature. This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority, not necessarily first in the list.
2. Check that the types check via pnpm tsc and that the tests that are related to areas you have touched pass
3. Update the PRD with the work that was done
4. Append your progress to a progress.txt file for the milestone. Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase
5. Make a git commit of your feature. ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE
If you notice while working on a feature that the PRD is complete, let me know
